
IMPORTANT NOTE ON HOW TO BUILD AND RUN THE PROJECT

 * Output all projects build to a common assembly directory. 
 
 * Copy src/assembly/* to the common assembly directory
 
This is for convinience reasons, it is certainly possible to setup your
own assembly from scratch but that will need that you place style SWF's in the current position for instance.
